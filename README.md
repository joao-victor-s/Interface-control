# LabREI Project: Load and Source Control and Visualization

Welcome to the LabREI project repository! This project aims to develop a robust solution for controlling and visualizing loads and energy sources. The system provides an intuitive and powerful interface for effectively monitoring and managing devices.

## Features

- **Load and Source Control**: Manage and control various types of loads and energy sources.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Track device metrics and status in real-time.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Navigate through a user-friendly interface to configure and monitor devices.

## Development Branches

### `modbus_integration`

This branch focuses on integrating with the Modbus protocol. The integration will allow the system to communicate with and control devices that use the Modbus protocol, expanding the system's compatibility with a broader range of industrial equipment.

- **Objective**: Implement Modbus protocol support for control and monitoring.
- **Status**: In development. Core functionalities are being implemented and tested.

### `mqtt_integration`

This branch aims to integrate with the MQTT protocol. MQTT support will enable the system to connect and communicate with IoT devices, providing greater flexibility and scalability in data communication.

- **Objective**: Add MQTT protocol support to facilitate integration with IoT devices.
- **Status**: In development. We are implementing and refining MQTT-related features.
